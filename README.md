## About
[IPRES](https://ipres.xyz) is a simple interactive presentation editor based on HTML5 and jQuery. The main purpose of this tool is to create HTML presentation with interactive charts (JS-based, e.g., Highcharts, Chartjs, D3js; default to [HighCharts](https://highcharts.com)). You can integrate it with available html presentation framworks, e.g. reveal.js, deck.js, webslides. It can also be used as a quick html page generator.

## Features

- JavaScript-based: online or run locally; no installation needed
- Fully customisable: you can change the head and foot part according to different HTML presentation frameworks (or to use the default one), including reveal.js, deck.js, webslides. You can also use the theme files from those tools.
- (Very) Easy to use: just copy and paste the html code and generate the code.
